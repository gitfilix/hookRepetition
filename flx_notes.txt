useState

useState always returns an array with two elements: 
1. element: state snapshot (current state /or updated state) (->pointer at state)
2. element: A Function for updateing this state 

the state will be managed by react behind the scenes


rules:
use on the root-level at a component. 
(not allowed in a for loop, in a if statement below)

useEffect

1. executes: After every render cycle!
2. [] empty dependency array acts like componentDidMount onliy runs ONCE (after first render)

useReducer:
when working with useReducer, React will re-render the component wehnever your reducer returns a new state
